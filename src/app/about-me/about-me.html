      <p class="about-paragraph">
        With a year of professional experience in frontend development, I specialize in building scalable, maintainable
        applications with Angular and TypeScript. My approach is grounded in translating complex designs into
        pixel-perfect, responsive user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I am deeply committed to the principles of clean code and continuous learning. When I'm not building with
        Angular, you'll find me doing a deep dive into backend development with Python and Django, or sharpening my
        full-stack skills with React and Node.js.
